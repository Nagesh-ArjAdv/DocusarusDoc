# What is DeliveryHub?

<div className="hero-image">
  <img src="/img/gpt.svg" alt="DeliveryHub Platform" />
</div>

<Admonition type="info" icon="🚀" title="Next-Generation Data Fulfillment">
DeliveryHub is a next-generation data fulfillment platform that empowers organizations to seamlessly **share**, **deliver**, and **customize datasets** across multiple clouds, regions, and tools—**without the complexity of traditional data pipelines**.
</Admonition>

At its core, DeliveryHub transforms raw or refined data into secure, **governed Data Products** that can be instantly shared with internal teams, partners, and customers. Eliminate the need to maintain fragile pipelines, handle complex replication logic, or manage underlying infrastructure—DeliveryHub takes care of it all, so your teams can focus on **delivering value through data**.

## Why does DeliveryHub exist?

Organizations increasingly need to deliver data:

<div className="feature-grid">
  <div className="feature-item">
    <span className="feature-icon">☁️</span>
    <span>Across multiple cloud providers</span>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    <span className="feature-icon">📊</span>
    <span>Between diverse analytics platforms</span>
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    <span className="feature-icon">👥</span>
    <span>To internal teams and external customers</span>
  </div>
</div>

Most traditional solutions rely on hand-built pipelines or fragile integrations.

✔ No-code experience for business users  
✔ Fully automated workflows for engineers

## Two Ways to Work with DeliveryHub

<Admonition type="note">
DeliveryHub offers two flexible operating models depending on how you want to manage and deliver your data — **persistent distribution** or **direct movement**.
</Admonition>

<Tabs groupId="operating-modes">
  <TabItem value="tables" label="DeliveryHub Tables" default>
    
### DeliveryHub Tables (Managed Data Layer)

DeliveryHub provisions and maintains a **DeliveryHub Table** — a secure, analytics-ready version of your source data hosted in DeliveryHub's infrastructure.

#### With this model, you can:

<div className="checklist">

- ✅ Automatically sync data on your preferred schedule
- ✅ Build reusable Data Products without touching the original source
- ✅ Distribute curated datasets to Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, S3, GCS, and more
- ✅ Use Regional Copies for faster, in-location delivery

</div>

<Admonition type="success" title="Benefits">
Because your data is already staged inside DeliveryHub, every delivery is:

✔ **Faster**  
✔ **More reliable**  
✔ **Consistent** across all destinations  
✔ **Free** from repeated source extraction
</Admonition>

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Direct Transfers">
    
### Direct Transfers (Pipeline Mode)

If you don't need a managed copy, DeliveryHub can move data directly from source to destination in real time.

#### You still benefit from:

<div className="feature-list">

- 🔧 Configurable pipelines
- 🔄 Built-in format normalization
- 📅 Centralized scheduling & monitoring
- ♻️ Automatic retries and failure recovery
- 📊 Detailed logs and observability

</div>

<Admonition type="info">
Each transfer runs independently — there is **no intermediate storage layer**.  
Data is pulled directly from your source at execution time.
</Admonition>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
